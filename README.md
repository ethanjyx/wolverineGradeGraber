wolverineGradeGraber
====================

This program can be used to grab grades from Wolverine Access, save it to your local disk, and send email notifications if there are changes.

### Installation
Some simple things you need to run: 
* python and its selenium library
* a gmail account
* a Firefox browser (for other browsers, some additional drivers are required)



I'm always ready to help anyone who wants to try.

### How it works?
With the help of selenium, the program will grab the grades from Wolverine Access every 10 seconds. It saves current version of transcript and compares with previous versions. If there are changes, emails will be sent.

### Final words
Wish everybody great grades and Merry Christmas!...
